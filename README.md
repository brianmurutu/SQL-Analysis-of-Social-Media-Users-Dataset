# SQL Analysis of Social Media Users Dataset

This repository explores the [Social Media Users dataset (Average Time Spent By A User On Social Media.csv)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_pw30q72z-09Arcu4dfnS4CUCUsNUx-G/view) using SQL for data filtering and analysis. I've investigated patterns in user behavior and engagement across different social media platforms.

## Key Highlights

* **Dataset:** [Social Media Users (Average Time Spent By A User On Social Media.csv)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_pw30q72z-09Arcu4dfnS4CUCUsNUx-G/view) 
* **SQL Skills:** Filtering, aggregation, sorting, and potentially joins/subqueries (depending on your analysis)
* **Challenges & Observations:** I'll detail any difficulties faced during import or analysis, along with an interesting finding about the data itself.
* **Queries:** SQL code demonstrating how I filtered and explored the data to uncover insights.

## Example Questions

* Which social media platform has the highest average usage time?
* How does average usage time vary across different age groups or demographics?
* Are there peak usage times or days of the week?
* Can we identify any correlations between usage time and other user characteristics (if available in the dataset)?
